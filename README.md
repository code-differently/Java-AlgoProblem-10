# Seeing Half

Provided a message, return a new message where every character that appears once in the original message is doubled in the new message.
Also, if a character is doubled in the original message, it should only occur once in the new message.

## Example 1

### Input
Message: Kaleb

### Output
KKaalleebb

## Example 2

### Input
Message: Hello World

### Output
HHeeloo  WWoorrlldd

### Explanation
Every letter in the original message occurs only once so they will all be doubled in the new message. The expetion is that `l` occurs as a double in the original message so it should only occur as a single letter in the new messgae.
